Our client was looking to establish their first workloads in AWS, and wanted to make sure that appropriate foundations were put in place to build on top of. We were there to help them achive this goal.

After a period of initial investigation we started building a cloud platform team, working closely with existing architecture / networking / security personnel. General requirements were gathered through a process of collaboration and discovery, which became the basis for our roadmap and development backlog. As we built the systems and processes around the core cloud foundations we worked in parallel with product development teams to ensure that their specific needs and timeframes were met. The team eventually grew to 15 people and was actively engaged with every one of the bank's cloud development and migration endeavours.

One of the key concepts behind this work was that of "self-service infrastructure", in which development teams are able to provision and support their own applications and the supporting cloud resources they depend upon, within the bounds of a secure environment where the underlying core infrastructure is taken care of.

Banks traditionally have challenges around these areas, which becomes a key point of contention for developers and project teams, impacting the time-to-market for new ideas. We believe that there are great gains to be made in these areas, available to organisations that are willing to explore new ways of working.


Considerations
--------------

- AWS Organisation strategy
    - SSO integration
    - Multi-account strategy
- On-prem connectivity and hybrid networking
- Assisting with a lightweight decision-making process, which allowed the use of best-of-breed tools
- Automated provisioning of "default" (centrally managed) infrastructure
- Terraform Cloud
- Establishment of a Dev/SecOps practise contributing code modules offering pre-approved infrastructure patterns
